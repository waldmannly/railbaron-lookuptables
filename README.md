This is a modified verion of Danny Stevens' rail baron code (from https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32296/rail-barron-trip-an...) that allows for you to input your own die rolls because roll die is one of the best parts of rail baron.

Also big props to Danny Stevens for writing the original. Saved me tons of time.
